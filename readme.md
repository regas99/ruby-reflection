The challenge is:

Your challenge, should you choose to accept it, is to write a Ruby library that will modify an existing program to output the number of times a specific method is called.

You solution library should be required at the top of the host program, or via ruby's -r flag (i.e. ruby -r ./solution.rb host_program.rb)

Your solution library should read the environment variable COUNT_CALLS_TO to determine the method it should count. Valid method signatures are Array#map!, ActiveRecord::Base#find, Base64.encode64, etc.

Your solution library should count calls to that method, and print the method signature and the number of times it was called when the program exits.

Also, your solution should have a minimal impact on the program's running time. Sorry set_trace_func.

Here is an example of a one line program which is altered to count calls to String#size

COUNT_CALLS_TO='String#size' ruby -r ./solution.rb -e '(1..100).each{|i| i.to_s.size if i.odd? }'
String#size called 50 times

Here's another more complex example:

COUNT_CALLS_TO='B#foo' ruby -r ./solution.rb -e 'module A; def foo; end; end; class B; include A; end; 10.times{B.new.foo}'
B#foo callThe challenge is:
